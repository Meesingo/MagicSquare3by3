# MagicSquare3by3
## Introduction
This program (supposedly) solves a 3-by-3 magic square!

Note that this program is not well-programmed and is just for fun. It is intended for Python newbies. It is so crude that I did not use a single class, and it currently can only run integers (to minimize calculation time). It'll be better.

This program is programmed using Python 3 Language.
